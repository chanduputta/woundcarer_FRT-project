### Problem Statement
Most of injury/surgery cases become complicated if the wounds are not manage appropriately i.e improper maintenance which leading to worsen the condition. **Proper precautions in treating patients** can improve wound recovery. In emergency cases the patient must get to the hospital as soon as possible. But in many conditions, it is common to see **First aid is able to manage/control the situation** and get to the hospital on time.
