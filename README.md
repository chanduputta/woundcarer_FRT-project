### Industry

 * **HEALTH**

### Problem Statement
Most of injury/surgery cases become complicated if the wounds are not manage appropriately i.e improper maintenance which leading to worsen the condition. **Proper precautions in treating patients** can improve wound recovery. In emergency cases the patient must get to the hospital as soon as possible. But in many conditions, it is common to see **First aid is able to manage/control the situation** and get to the hospital on time. The most of the non medical and not paraMedical person are not always aware about the **FirstAid** of the injury and the **minor treatment**

- Skin cut/tears
- Surgical wounds or stitches
- thermal chemical or electrical burns, etc.,

Through this ChatBot, one can ask steps to take firstaid of injury and maintainence tips to take care of such wounds.
